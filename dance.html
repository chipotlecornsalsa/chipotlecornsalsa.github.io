        <h1> Dance Parody (2016) </h1>
        
        <p> My first animation I've ever created. The dance is based on another animation show called <i>Kekkai Sensen</i> but the characters are my own. I took the ending scene of the show and sort of rotoscoped it in the shape and design of my own characters. In addition, the curtains and the spotlight were something I had to make on my own. The entire animation was done in 3 full days and in Photoshop. I used audicity to edit the music because I haven't learned about Adobe Premiere yet. Furthermore, I animated this in the most unconventional and difficult way possible but I am still proud of it. </p>
