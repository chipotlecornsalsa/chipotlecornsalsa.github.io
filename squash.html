        <p> A short character animation assignment. This project was called Squash and Stretch. I had to animate a hand (in my case, I did 2) squishing or stretching a character, I had created, in a certain way. There is some subtle squash and stretch but in the end, I mostly used smears to emphasize the characterâ€™s movement. It also works in a loop! This was drawn in Adobe Animate. </p>
