        <p> This was a group collaboration assignment called the Tableaux project for my stop-motion class. It focused on creating 24 different camera movements: 10 live-action, 10 stop-motion, and 4 miscellaneous. I worked with two friends of mine and all together, we designed a set made out of found objects which created a space for the camera to explore. We took turns directing the camera, shot the images in DragonFrame and added sound in Adobe Premiere.</p>
