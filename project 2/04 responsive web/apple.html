        <h1> Apple Toss (2018) </h1>
        
        <p> A short character animation assignment. This project was called <i>Drop it Like itâ€™s Hot</i>. The class had to portray a realistic throw and fall by applying physics to the object that is being tossed. The character had to be in 3/4ths position. This was done entirely in Adobe Animate. </p>
